Verstappen competed in Formula One between 1994 and 2003. Born and raised in Dutch Limburg, Verstappen began competitive kart racing aged eight. After a successful karting career—culminating in two direct-drive Karting European Championships in 1989—Verstappen graduated to junior formulae. He started his career in Formula Opel Lotus, winning the Benelux Championship in 1992. Later that year, he also won the EFDA Nations Cup, representing the Netherlands. Progressing to German Formula Three in 1993, Verstappen won the title in his rookie season with Opel, further winning the Masters of Formula 3. Signing for Benetton as a test driver in 1994, Verstappen made his Formula One debut at the Brazilian Grand Prix, replacing the injured JJ Lehto to partner Michael Schumacher for the opening two rounds of the season. Verstappen formally replaced Lehto after the Canadian Grand Prix, scoring two podiums in his rookie season before being replaced by Johnny Herbert in Japan. His podium in Hungary made him the first Dutch driver to score a podium finish in Formula One. Verstappen competed for Simtek in 1995 before the team went bankrupt five rounds into the season, returning to his test driver role with Benetton. He became a full-time driver for Footwork in 1996. After non-classified championship finishes in 1997 and 1998 with Tyrrell and Stewart, respectively, Verstappen became a test driver for the Honda project in 1999. He returned to a race seat with Arrows in 2000, competing with them for a further two seasons. After a year hiatus, Verstappen completed his final Formula One season with Minardi in 2003. Following his departure, Verstappen moved to A1 Grand Prix with the Netherlands for the 2005–06 season, achieving his sole victory in the South Africa feature race. He then competed in sportscar racing in 2008, winning both the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Le Mans Series in the LMP2 class with Van Merksteijn. In rallying, he contested the 2022 Ypres Rally as an independent entrant, and has competed in the European Rally Championship since 2025. Since 2002, Verstappen has coached and managed his son Max from karting at an early age to winning four Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles. Max's successes in the sport have renewed public scrutiny of Verstappen, who has faced several allegations of assault spanning two decades.

Ricciardo also prefers to carry more speed through the corner by making it more of a 'U' shape, utilising a little rear instability on entry to turn in, and enough grip to rotate the car mid-corner without the rear breaking away.[1] Public image[edit] Ricciardo at the 2021 United States Grand Prix Ricciardo was regarded as one of the most prominent names in Formula One,[2] known for his laid back nature and smile, with The New York Times describing him in 2016 saying, \"If a survey could be made of the 22 Formula One drivers to establish who smiles the most, has the sunniest disposition and seems to be generally the nicest guy, Ricciardo would surely be the leader.\"[3][4][5][6] His personal profile grew with the success of the reality show Drive to Survive, where he has been called \"the face of the show\".[3][7][8] After the 2021 season, Ricciardo was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2022 Australia Day Honours for \"significant service to motor sport as a competitor and ambassador, and to the community\".[9][10] Ricciardo is often referred to as \"the honey badger\" referencing his racing style, explaining how \"[i]t's supposed to be the most fearless animal in the animal kingdom. When you look at it, he seems quite cute and cuddly, but as soon as someone crosses his territory in a way he doesn't like, he turns into a bit of a savage and he'll go after anything – tigers, pythons – he turns very quickly, but he's a good guy.\"[11][12] On 8 February 2015, during the third episode of series 22 of the popular British motoring television programme Top Gear, Ricciardo became the fastest Formula One driver to perform a lap of the Top Gear test track during the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car feature, beating the previous record-holder Lewis Hamilton with a time of 1:42.2.[13] ^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}Mitchell-Malm, Scott (30 October 2023). \"The Key Difference To McLaren That Makes Ricciardo's Revival Real\".

Pérez was runner-up in the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in 2023 with Red Bull, and won six Grands Prix across 14 seasons. Born and raised in Guadalajara, Pérez began competitive kart racing aged six. Graduating to junior formulae in 2004, Pérez won his first championship in the national class of the 2007 British Formula 3 International Series. He progressed to the GP2 Series in 2009, finishing runner-up to Pastor Maldonado the following season with Addax. A member of the Ferrari Driver Academy since 2010, Pérez signed for Sauber in 2011 to partner Kamui Kobayashi, making his Formula One debut at the Australian Grand Prix, where both were disqualified for an illegal rear wing. Pérez found greater success for the team in 2012, achieving his maiden podium finish in Malaysia, and repeating this feat in Canada and Italy. For the 2013 season, Pérez moved to McLaren, replacing Lewis Hamilton to partner Jenson Button. After a podium-less season for McLaren, Pérez signed with Force India in 2014. He scored five podiums with the team before their re-branding to Racing Point mid-way through the 2018 season. Pérez placed fourth in the championship with Racing Point in 2020, taking his maiden win at the Sakhir Grand Prix, having been in last-place at the end of the first lap. Replaced by Sebastian Vettel at the re-branded Aston Martin for 2021, Pérez signed for Red Bull to partner Max Verstappen; he took his first victory for the team at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Pérez took further wins in 2022 at the Monaco and Singapore Grands Prix, amongst his maiden pole position in Saudi Arabia, finishing the season third overall. Pérez finished runner-up to Verstappen in the 2023 World Drivers' Championship, after additional victories in Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan. Following a winless 2024 campaign, Pérez and Red Bull mutually agreed to terminate his contract, having contributed to two World Constructors' Championships. He is contracted to return with Cadillac in 2026. Pérez has achieved six race wins, three pole positions, 12 fastest laps and 39 podiums in Formula One. He holds the Formula One records for the most starts before a race win (190) and the most races before a pole position (219)."

Alonso has won two Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles, which he won in 2005 and 2006 with Renault, and has won 32 Grands Prix across 22 seasons. In endurance racing, Alonso won the 2018–19 FIA World Endurance Championship and is a two-time winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Toyota, and remains the only driver to have won both the Formula One World Drivers' Championship and the World Sportscar/World Endurance Drivers' Championship; he also won the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2019 with WTR. Born and raised in Oviedo to a working-class family, Alonso began kart racing aged three and won several regional, national and continental titles. He progressed to junior formulae aged 17, winning the Euro Open by Nissan in 1999 before finishing fourth in International Formula 3000. Alonso signed for Minardi in 2001, making his Formula One debut at the Australian Grand Prix. After a non-scoring rookie season, he joined Renault as a test driver before his promotion to a full-time seat in 2003; he became the then-youngest polesitter and race winner at the Malaysian and Hungarian Grands Prix, respectively, before achieving several podiums across his 2004 campaign. Alonso won his maiden title after winning seven Grands Prix in 2005, becoming the first World Drivers' Champion from Spain and the then-youngest in Formula One history, aged 24. He successfully defended his title from Michael Schumacher in 2006. Alonso moved to McLaren for 2007, finishing one point behind champion Kimi Räikkönen and returning to Renault amidst inter-team tensions. He won multiple races in 2008—including the controversial Singapore Grand Prix—before enduring a winless 2009 campaign. Alonso signed for Ferrari in 2010, finishing runner-up to Sebastian Vettel by four points in the third-placed F10. He took a single victory in 2011 as Red Bull consolidated their advantage, before finishing runner-up to Vettel again in 2012 and 2013—the former by three points and the latter in the third-placed F138. After a winless 2014 season amidst new engine regulations, Alonso returned to McLaren under Honda power in 2015. He remained with the team until the end of 2018, resulting in limited success, before his first retirement. Alonso then moved into sportscar racing with Toyota, winning the FIA World Endurance Championship, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans twice. He returned to Formula One in 2021 with Alpine, recording his first podium in seven years at the Qatar Grand Prix, and breaking the record for most career starts in 2022. Alonso moved to Aston Martin for his 2023 campaign, achieving several podiums as he finished fourth in the World Drivers' Championship; he scored his 100th career podium at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. In 2024, he became the first driver to contest four-hundred Grands Prix. As of the 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix, Alonso has achieved 32 race wins, 22 pole positions, 26 fastest laps and 106 podiums in Formula One. Alonso is contracted to remain at Aston Martin until at least the end of the 2026 season. In addition to holding the most race starts (420), his longevity has broken several Formula One records. Alonso won the 2001 Race of Champions Nations' Cup, and thrice entered the Indianapolis 500 in 2017, 2019 and 2020. He runs a driver management firm and has been a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2005. Alonso has been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Order of Sports Merit and twice been inducted into the FIA Hall of Fame. ^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"Alonso signs new F1 deal with Aston Martin\". www.formula1.com.

It's all about that mindset and putting that lap together in qualifying when it is needed and the pressure is super-high. This is an exercise I have always loved. I've always said I drive a lot with intuition, I work a lot, of course. But that is where one of my strengths is—that I feel things very, very quickly. —Leclerc, asked by BBC Sport whether he was the fastest qualifier in Formula One in 2024[1] Leclerc has a strong qualifying history in Formula One, where he holds the record for most pole positions without a World Drivers' Championship (27).[2] He also holds the record in either FIA Formula 2 or its predecessor GP2 for the most pole positions in a season (8).[3] His driving style tends to favour a car with oversteer, allowing for precise micro-corrections and high cornering speeds, which has aided his qualifying pace.[4] He became the youngest recipient of the FIA Pole Trophy in 2019 for achieving the most pole positions,[5] a feat he repeated in 2022.[6] Critics have noted his ability to outperform his machinery in qualifying conditions, which has frequently led to his one-lap pace relatively surpassing his race pace and a pole–win conversion rate of 18.5%.[7][8] Andrew Benson of BBC Sport described his pole lap at the 2019 Singapore Grand Prix as \"one of the qualifying performances of the season\".[9] A study by Amazon Web Services in 2020 listed Leclerc as the seventh-fastest Formula One driver of all time.[10] After his back-to-back poles at the Monaco and Azerbaijan Grands Prix in 2021, then-teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. proclaimed Leclerc as the best qualifier in Formula One.[11] Edd Straw of The Race commented that \"if you’re talking about a driver who can consistently wring the neck of a car regardless of its limitations and successfully live on the edge in a livewire qualifying lap then you need to look no further than [Leclerc]\", and that \"his willingness to be on or even slightly over the limit, mitigated by his outstanding car control when things do get untidy, allows him to drag stunning lap times even out of cars that aren’t handling well.\"[11] He described his \"relentless pursuit of perfect laps\" as a characteristic that could make Leclerc \"one of [the] all-time greatest qualifiers\".[12] Laurence Edmondson of ESPN described his pole lap at the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix as his \"latest example of his pinpoint precision and masterful speed\", adding that he was \"undoubtedly making a claim for the title of [Formula One]'s fastest driver over a single lap\"; he praised \"his ability to extract the fastest laps consistently while dealing with the pressure of a title fight\".[13] Mark Hughes described him as \"Senna-like\" at Monaco, noting his 5 km/h (3.1 mph) advantage at the high-speed Tabac in 2025.[14] His pole lap at the Hungarian Grand Prix that year—where he usurped the dominant McLaren MCL39—was described as \"sensational\".[a][18] Karun Chandhok has acclaimed Leclerc as the fastest qualifier of all time,[19] and Martin Brundle opined he was the fastest amongst the 2023 drivers.[20] Racecraft[edit] Leclerc (back) racing against Lewis Hamilton (front) at the 2022 British Grand Prix Leclerc has been noted by critics for his proficiency in wheel-to-wheel racing.[21] After ceding the lead of the 2019 Austrian Grand Prix to Max Verstappen in the closing laps, Leclerc claimed his move was \"not the way you overtake\" and that he would adjust his aggression going forward.[22][23] The following race, he beat Verstappen in a hard-fought contest for third, which Vijay Pattni of Top Gear summarised as \"holy heck, what a fight. Both younglings threw their cars at each other, both refused to yield any space, and both—miracously—avoided coming together.\"[24] Leclerc declared it \"the most fun [he'd] had in [Formula One]\",[25] whilst Verstappen added \"I think he was a little bit sore still from Austria so he was defending really hard, but it's fine, I'm all for that\".[26] He was nicknamed il Predestinato (lit. 'the Predestined') in Italian media after defending his lead at the 2019 Italian Grand Prix from both Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas.[b] He was praised for his first-corner overtake on Bottas at the 2021 Spanish Grand Prix,[27] with Jonathan Noble of Motorsport.com describing the move as \"sensational\".[28] Leclerc received acclaim for his battle with Verstappen at the 2022 Bahrain Grand Prix, noted for his effective use of the drag reduction system.[29][30][31] He was praised by Hamilton after their battle at the 2022 British Grand Prix, where Leclerc overtook him around the outside of Copse on older tyres.[32] Alex Kalinauckas of Autosport lauded his racecraft after the 2024 season, highlighting several instances of his defensive driving against faster machinery, as well as an overtake on George Russell at the Chinese Grand Prix.[33] He was further acclaimed for his tyre management at the Italian Grand Prix.[34] He has also been criticised for race-ending mistakes throughout his early seasons in Formula One, particularly at the 2020 Italian, 2020 Sakhir, and 2022 French Grands Prix;[35][36][37] he was further penalised for causing a collision with Verstappen at the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix and for erratically defending from Russell at the 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix.[38][39] The 1996 World Drivers' Champion, Damon Hill, described his racing mentality as \"win or bust\".[40] Helmet[edit] Leclerc's 2020 helmet design featured the flag of Monaco surrounded by his logo in rosso corsa. Leclerc's helmet design features a base colour of rosso corsa with a Monégasque flag stripe along the lid.[41] The words \"Papa\" and \"Jules\" are inscribed on the side, in remembrance of his father, Hervé Leclerc, and his godfather, Jules Bianchi.[42] He wore a full tribute helmet to both at the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix and to Bianchi at the 2024 Japanese Grand Prix, the tenth anniversary of his fatal accident.[43][44] He had previously worn a tribute for Sebastian Vettel at the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix—their final race as teammates.[45] Controversy arose over his Gilles Villeneuve design for the 2023 Canadian Grand Prix, after the Villeneuve family claimed he did not ask for permission; Jacques Villeneuve permitted it after talking to Leclerc.[46] He wore a tribute for departing teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. at the 2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.[47] ^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}Benson, Andrew (18 July 2024). \"Leclerc on 'incredible' Hamilton, mindset & Ferrari dip\".

Born and raised in Montreal, Stroll is the son of billionaire businessman Lawrence Stroll, owner of the Aston Martin F1 Team, and his Belgian ex-wife. Stroll began competitive kart racing aged 10, winning several regional and national titles. A member of the Ferrari Driver Academy since 2010, Stroll graduated to junior formulae in 2014, winning his first title at the Italian F4 Championship that year with Prema. He then won the Toyota Racing Series in 2015 with M2, and dominated the FIA Formula 3 European Championship in 2016 with Prema. Following his record-breaking successes in Formula Three, Stroll signed for Williams in 2017 to partner Felipe Massa, making his Formula One debut at the Australian Grand Prix, aged 18. He scored his maiden podium finish in Azerbaijan that year, becoming the second-youngest driver to score a podium. Stroll finished a season-best eighth at the same Grand Prix in 2018, driving the FW41. After two seasons at Williams, Stroll signed for Racing Point—having recently been acquired by his father—in 2019 to partner Sergio Pérez, finishing fourth at the rain-affected German Grand Prix. In 2020, Stroll achieved his maiden pole position at the Turkish Grand Prix, with podiums at the Italian and Sakhir Grands Prix. Stroll remained at the re-branded Aston Martin in 2021, partnered by Sebastian Vettel for two seasons. Stroll has been teammates with Fernando Alonso since 2023, finishing a career-best tenth in the World Drivers' Championship that year. As of the 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix, Stroll has achieved one pole position and three podiums in Formula One. Stroll is contracted to remain at Aston Martin until at least the end of the 2026 season. Outside of Formula One, Stroll competed in two editions of the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2016 and 2018 with CGR and Jackie Chan DC, respectively. ^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"Aston Martin confirm Stroll to remain at team\".

Graduating from karting to junior formulae in 2008, Magnussen won his first championship at the 2008 Danish Formula Ford Championship. He then finished as runner-up to António Félix da Costa at the Formula Renault NEC in 2009, and to Felipe Nasr at the British Formula 3 International Series in 2011. Progressing to Formula Renault 3.5 in 2012, Magnussen won the championship the following season with DAMS. A member of the McLaren Young Driver Programme since 2010, Magnussen signed with McLaren in 2014 to partner Jenson Button. He finished second on his Formula One debut at the Australian Grand Prix, scoring his maiden podium finish and becoming the highest-finishing debutant since Jacques Villeneuve in 1996. Replaced by Fernando Alonso for 2015, Magnussen continued at McLaren as a reserve driver, substituting for Alonso at the season-opener. Magnussen completed a stint at Renault in 2016, before competing with Haas from 2017 until the conclusion of the 2020 season, finishing a career-best ninth in the 2018 World Drivers' Championship. In 2021, Magnussen moved to the IMSA SportsCar Championship with Cadillac, winning the Detroit Classic; he also contested one round of the IndyCar Series with Arrow McLaren, as well as the 24 Hours of Le Mans with High Class. Magnussen returned to Haas in 2022 to replace Nikita Mazepin, achieving his maiden pole position at the São Paulo Grand Prix. He retained his seat in 2023 and 2024, becoming the first driver since former teammate Romain Grosjean in 2012 to receive a race ban after the latter Italian Grand Prix, before departing at the end of the season. Magnussen achieved one pole position, three fastest laps and one podium finish in Formula One. He holds the Formula One record for the most career starts without leading a lap (185). Magnussen returned to sportscar racing in 2025, joining BMW as a factory driver."

Born in Westminster and raised in Suffolk, Albon is the son of English racing driver Nigel Albon and his Thai wife, as well as the nephew of Mark Albon. After a successful karting career—culminating in his victories at the junior direct-drive Karting World Cup and Karting European Championship in 2010—Albon graduated to junior formulae. Following three seasons in the Formula Renault Eurocup from 2012 to 2014, Albon progressed to the FIA Formula 3 European Championship in 2015. He moved to the GP3 Series for 2016, finishing runner-up to Charles Leclerc in his rookie season with ART. Graduating to FIA Formula 2 in 2017, Albon finished third in the championship the following season with DAMS. Previously a member of the Red Bull Junior Team in 2012, Albon signed for Toro Rosso in 2019, making his Formula One debut at the Australian Grand Prix; after 12 races, he was promoted to parent team Red Bull, replacing Pierre Gasly to partner Max Verstappen. In 2020, he took his maiden podium finishes at the Tuscan and Bahrain Grands Prix, becoming the first Thai driver to achieve a podium in Formula One. Replaced by Sergio Pérez in 2021, Albon continued as a reserve driver for Red Bull and the re-branded AlphaTauri, contesting the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters with Red Bull AF Corse alongside Liam Lawson. Albon signed for Williams in 2022 to replace George Russell, ending his association with Red Bull at the conclusion of his first season. He has remained at Williams through the 2025 season. As of the 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix, Albon has achieved two podium finishes in Formula One. Albon is contracted to remain at Williams until at least the end of the 2026 season. .mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none} ^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}Cleeren, Filip (5 February 2024) [5 February 2024]. \"Albon tied to Williams until the end of F1 2025, clarifies Vowles\".

Born and raised in Pilar, Buenos Aires, Colapinto began competitive kart racing at age nine, winning several regional and national championships. Graduating to junior formulae in 2018, Colapinto won his first title at the 2019 F4 Spanish Championship with Drivex. He then finished third in the Formula Renault Eurocup and the Toyota Racing Series in 2020. Colapinto moved into sportscar racing in 2021, competing in the LMP2 class of the FIA World Endurance Championship, European Le Mans Series and Asian Le Mans Series for G-Drive, finishing third at the latter. He also contested Formula Regional European with MP, finishing sixth overall. Colapinto progressed to FIA Formula 3 in 2022, finishing fourth the following season with MP and graduating to FIA Formula 2. A member of the Williams Driver Academy since 2023, Colapinto made his Formula One debut with Williams at the 2024 Italian Grand Prix, replacing Logan Sargeant for the remainder of the 2024 season as an interim for the incoming Carlos Sainz Jr. With his debut, he became the first Argentine driver to compete in Formula One since Gastón Mazzacane in 2001. Colapinto scored his maiden points finish at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, repeating this feat in the United States. He joined Alpine as a reserve driver for 2025 and was promoted after six Grands Prix to replace Jack Doohan, where he has achieved a season-best result of eleventh at the Dutch Grand Prix. ^ Cite error: The named reference contract was invoked but never defined (see the help page)."

      "driver_profile": "Driver profile[edit] Driving style[edit] Hamilton won by over a minute from second-placed Nick Heidfeld at the 2008 British Grand Prix. Hamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid,[1] excelling across a wide range of areas.[2] He has been described as having an aggressive driving style,[3] with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car. Mark Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is \"super-hard on the brakes ... but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there's no wasted grip but no locked wheels either.\"[4][5] Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable.[4] Hamilton has also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing track conditions; throughout his career, he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a result of his ability to carry momentum through corners.[6] Pedro de la Rosa, a former test driver for McLaren who worked with Hamilton and Alonso, rated the pair as the best he had seen first hand, stating that they shared a strength in terms of \"how much speed they can run into the apex [of a corner] and still have a decent exit speed\", highlighting in particular their ability to maintain this speed when their rear tyres have lost grip during a longer stint.[7] Hamilton has been praised for his consistency, especially in his time at Mercedes. From 2017 to 2018, he finished 33 consecutive races in point-scoring positions, a run brought to an end as a result of mechanical issues.[8][9] Ross Brawn wrote that \"over the course of [2018], Hamilton hardly put a foot wrong, winning not only the races he should have, but also some where the opposition was stronger, and that is the true mark of a champion.\"[10] Ahead of the 2021 season, Martin Brundle, commentating for Sky Sports, said \"I think what has stood out about Lewis over the years is how few mistakes he makes, how complete he is and clean ... he just never makes a mistake [in] wheel-to-wheel combat [or] in qualifying ... He just doesn't fade, mentally or physically.\"[11] Hamilton won the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix in torrential rain, and compared the conditions to his victory at the 2008 British Grand Prix. Hamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in those conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Hamilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute, the largest margin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.[12][13] During the turbo-hybrid era, Hamilton remained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 German Grand Prix, where his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen.[14] His wet weather drive at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix where he clinched his seventh world title was widely acclaimed, with Joe Saward describing it as \"one of his greatest performances\".[15] Qualifying sixth for the race after Mercedes struggled with tyre temperatures and a track that lacked grip after being recently resurfaced, during the race he gambled on a one-stop strategy in mixed conditions whilst his rivals chose to change their tyres for a second time, enabling him to take the lead and win by over 30 seconds. His performance was contrasted with that of his team-mate Bottas, who spun four times and finished a lap down in 14th place.[16][17][18] Hamilton cited the race as his \"stand-out\" performance of the season.[19] Hamilton is the most successful driver in Formula One history, holding the most amount of major driver records. Ayrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton's driving style, recalling: \"I think it's partly because I watched [him] when I was young and I thought 'this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity' and I went out there and tried it on the kart track. My whole approach to racing has developed from there.\"[20] He has been compared to Senna in raw speed.[21] In 2010, Hamilton drove Senna's original title-winning McLaren MP4/4 as part of a tribute documentary by the BBC motoring show Top Gear. In the documentary, along with fellow racing drivers, he named Senna as the number one driver ever.[22][23] Earlier in his career, Hamilton was criticised for being hot-headed at times, as demonstrated when he was disqualified in Imola in the GP2 Series for overtaking the safety car, something he went on to repeat four years later in Formula One at the 2010 European Grand Prix in Valencia.[24] Following his move to Mercedes, Hamilton was credited with demonstrating greater maturity, while maintaining his ruthlessness and aggression. The official Formula One website describes him as \"invariably a fierce but fair fighter\".[25] Reception[edit] .mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%;max-width:100%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:.5em 1.4em .8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:.5em 0 .8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{overflow:hidden;position:relative;margin:.5em auto .8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft span,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright span{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox>blockquote{margin:0;padding:0;border-left:0;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{text-align:center;font-size:110%;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote>:first-child{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote:last-child>:last-child{margin-bottom:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" “ \";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" ” \";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quote-title,.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quotebox-quote{display:block}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:640px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{width:100%!important;margin:0 0 .8em!important;float:none!important}} As a driver he is absolutely outstanding – as good as there's ever been. Apart from the talent, he's a good guy, he gets out on the street and supports and promotes Formula One. He is box office, 100 per cent. —Bernie Ecclestone, speaking of Hamilton in 2015[26] Hamilton has been described as the best driver of his generation,[27][28][15] and one of the greatest Formula One drivers[29][30] including by Chase Carey and Martin Brundle.[31][32] Several Formula One drivers and experts have described Hamilton as the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[note 1] Writing in Autocar, Jim Holden suggested Hamilton might not only be among the greatest British drivers in Formula One but one of the greatest British sportsmen.[44] Amongst receiving plaudits from experts and fans in and out of the sport, Hamilton has been a divisive figure in the eyes of the general public, with some journalists arguing his exploits on the track have been underappreciated.[45][46][47] Holden has suggested that racial bias may have contributed towards Hamilton's perceived lack of popularity relative to his achievements, with Hamilton's race and physical appearance—being mixed-race and often seen sporting earrings, braids and designer clothing—alienating some of the sport's traditional white, elderly male fanbase.[44] Others have attributed his lack of appreciation to the perceived predictability of results during the turbo-hybrid era, likening his period of dominance to that of Schumacher in the early 2000s, and to tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, all of whom became more appreciated in the latter part of their careers.[44][48] What strikes me now about him now is his maturity ... [Hamilton] recognises he is a role model and the influence he has and the responsibilities that come with it. He is far broader than purely a driver in [Formula One]. He has opinions about the environment, young people, fashion and music. That is part of the greater appeal of Lewis today. —David Richards, chairman of Motorsport UK, speaking of Hamilton in 2019[49] Hamilton's jet-set lifestyle and interests outside Formula One have been scrutinised.[50] He has been praised for disregarding convention and public opinion and has been described as one of the last superstar drivers.[48][51] Between race weekends Hamilton has on several occasions travelled around the world to explore a variety of interests, such as in 2018 where, after winning the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton flew to Shanghai and New York where he released his own designer clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger, before flying immediately back to, and winning, the next race in Singapore.[51] His Mercedes team-boss Toto Wolff has been vocal in his support for Hamilton's off-track pursuits, explaining how freedom allows Hamilton to function at his best.[46] Figures in the sport, such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner, have voiced their support for Hamilton's ability to connect with fans, while Bernie Ecclestone frequently commented on his admiration of Hamilton's ability to promote the sport, observing how he is happy to engage with fans, unlike some of his peers.[50] In 2019, The Telegraph sports journalist Luke Slater went as far as to argue that \"[t]here have been few better representatives of the sport than Hamilton ... [both] on and off the track.\"[52] Following Hamilton's knighthood in 2020,[53] newly appointed Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said that Hamilton is \"a true giant of our sport\" and that \"his influence is huge both in and out of a car\".[54] He was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that. —Fernando Alonso, speaking of Hamilton in 2017[55] A prodigious talent as a teenager, Hamilton established himself as one of the world's best drivers following his record-breaking rookie year. Paddy Lowe has suggested that \"he turned out to be the best rookie there has ever been\" and that \"his first half-season is just the most extraordinary in history.\"[7] After his first world title a year later, many people considered Hamilton the best driver of his generation.[56] Following Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel's four-year dominance of the sport, Hamilton's resolve was tested both professionally and personally as he did not finish higher than fourth in the Drivers' Championship from 2009 to 2013, leading some to question his status as the best driver in the sport.[57] In spite of this, Hamilton's less successful years with McLaren have also been cited as a demonstration of driving ability as Hamilton has won at least one race in fifteen consecutive seasons,[30] attracting high praise from experts and fellow drivers for extracting race-winning performances from cars that were not dominant.[55][58] Hamilton waving to fans after winning the 2018 Italian Grand Prix After Hamilton clinched his second and third World Championship titles with Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, David Coulthard declared Hamilton the best driver of his generation, calling him \"the Ayrton Senna of his era\".[27] As Hamilton became more widely considered the best driver of his era, public and expert debate moved from his status in modern Formula One to his status among the greatest drivers in history.[57] The next few seasons saw Hamilton eclipse a number of records, including achieving the most all-time pole positions ahead of Michael Schumacher, leading him to be regarded by some as the greatest qualifier in history.[59][60] After winning his fourth and fifth world titles, Hamilton's place among the greats of the sport became firmly established in the opinions of experts, rivals, and teammates alike,[61][62][63] including among others Fernando Alonso, Carlos Sainz Jr.,[64] Felipe Massa,[65] Gerhard Berger,[66] and Ross Brawn.[67] Some journalists and pundits also consider the possibility of Hamilton being the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[59][68] Following Hamilton clinching a sixth World Drivers' Championship title in 2019, ex-Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert acclaimed Hamilton as the greatest driver ever,[35] while Formula One staff writer Greg Stuart described Hamilton as \"arguably the most complete Formula [One] driver ever\".[1] After Hamilton won his seventh title in 2020, John Watson stated that Hamilton \"is, by a million miles, the greatest driver of his generation and you can argue he will go on to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time\", and highlighted his fearlessness as being key to his success, as evidenced by his performance against double world champion team-mate Alonso in his rookie season and his decision to leave McLaren for Mercedes.[38] Helmet[edit] Hamilton's 2007 helmet for McLaren From a young age, Hamilton's helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons. In later years, a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space.[69] Hamilton continued to run a yellow design throughout the early stages of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to switch to a white design with three red ribbons on the side.[70] In 2016, Hamilton added three stars beneath the ribbons, representing each of his World Drivers' Championships. Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions in 2017;[71] the winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details.[72] Over the following seasons, Hamilton began a tradition of adding more stars to his helmet upon winning each title.[73] Having switched back to a 2014-inspired white-and-red design in 2018,[74] Hamilton opted a different colour palette in 2020, which used matte black as base colour with purple details; he later added a Black Lives Matter emblem to the lid, in support of the movement.[75] In 2022, he moved to a fluorescent yellow design, retaining the purple details and championship stars.[76] Upon signing with Ferrari in 2025, Hamilton reverted to a design reminiscent of the early stages of his Formula One career, featuring yellow as the base color along with red accents and championship stars, complemented by the Ferrari emblem replacing the Mercedes logo.[77] Hamilton's first Mercedes helmet in 2013, featuring colour ribbons moved forward. Hamilton has used several one-off helmet designs across his career. Hamilton sported gold helmets for season finales three times in his career. After winning his fourth title in 2017, he entered the 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of the helmet with the words \"World Champion\".[78] He used similar designs in 2018 and 2019 with five and six stars, respectively.[73][79] This practice altered in 2020, when Hamilton wore his base helmet with gold outlines and accents, instead of a full gold design. Hamilton's special helmet design used for the 2021 São Paulo Grand Prix. Hamilton has also used one-off helmet designs to pay tribute to his influential figures. He has continuously brought special helmet designs to Brazilian Grands Prix, in tribute to Ayrton Senna.[80][81][82] Prior to the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, three-time world champion and Mercedes team personnel Niki Lauda, who played pivotal role in Hamilton's move to Mercedes, died. In tribute, Hamilton wore a special helmet design featuring Lauda's classic red-and-white palette with his name printed on the back, honoring the influence Lauda had on his career.[83] Other notable special designs include his rainbow helmet designs—used during the Qatar, Saudi Arabian and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix of 2021—in support of LGBTQ rights in the Middle East.[84] Hamilton used unique designs for the Japanese Grand Prix in 2022 and 2023, designed by Japanese artists Takashi Murakami and Hajime Sorayama, respectively.[85][86] Rivalries[edit] Fernando Alonso[edit] Alonso (left) and Hamilton (right) at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix Hamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents. The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco in 2007.[87] After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders.[88] McLaren denied favouring Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars ... nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.\"[88] Tensions resurfaced at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, where during the final qualifying session Hamilton went out on track ahead of Alonso and ignored requests from the team to let him through: the two drivers had been taking turns on a race-by-race basis to lead during qualifying, which gave the leading driver an edge due to the fuel load regulations then in place, and Alonso was due to lead in Hungary.[7] Hamilton was then delayed in the pits by Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of the session.[89] Alonso was relegated to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting Hamilton, who had qualified second, to first, while McLaren was docked Constructors' Championship points. Hamilton said he thought the penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of points.[90] Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident.[91] British motorsport journal Autosport claimed that this \"[led] Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso's pole\";[92] however, McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton that denied the use of any profanity.[93] As a result of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso reportedly collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period.[94][95] In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for 2008.[96] The rivalry between the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season;[97][98][99] Alonso and McLaren terminated their contract by mutual consent in November that year, ending his and Hamilton's time as teammates.[100] In subsequent years, tensions between the pair dissipated, and the mutual respect has grown,[101] with Alonso praising Hamilton in 2017 saying \"[Hamilton] was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\"[55] Alonso later described Hamilton as one of the top five greatest drivers of all time.[29] On the cool-down lap after Alonso's final race before his two-year hiatus in 2018, Hamilton joined Sebastian Vettel in paying tribute to Alonso by driving, each on one side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donuts.[102] Whilst teammates, Hamilton and Alonso won eight of 17 races held. Both drivers achieved four victories and 12 podium finishes, whilst Hamilton outqualified Alonso 10 of 17 times. At the end of their season as teammates, the pair were tied on 109 points, with Hamilton placing second and Alonso third in the World Drivers' Championship by virtue of Hamilton having more second-place finishes.[103] Nico Rosberg[edit] .mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}@media print{body.ns-0 .mw-parser-output .hatnote{display:none!important}}Main article: Hamilton–Rosberg rivalry Hamilton (left) and Rosberg (right) at the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix When Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013, he was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg. Over their four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance in Formula One, the pair's relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track.[104] Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when they were in karting.[105] They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European champion, with Rosberg not far behind. Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were competitive both on and off the track, saying that \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.\"[106] Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings;[106] Rosberg was born in Germany and raised in Monaco as the son of 1982 World Drivers' Champion Keke Rosberg, whereas Hamilton was raised on a council estate in Stevenage to a father who worked multiple jobs to fund his son's early karting career.[56] Pundit and commentator Will Buxton compared the character and driving styles of the pair, labelling Hamilton as the faster driver with more natural ability, as well as an intellect to match Rosberg's.[24] Buxton wrote: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;margin-top:0}@media(min-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{padding-left:1.6em}}Man to man against Rosberg, I can't recall a single race this year where in the same machinery Hamilton's fuel usage has been higher. He has made his tires last. He has had to fight from the back of the field time and again (think Germany, think Hungary) and yet he hasn't overworked his tires, he hasn't used too much fuel. He has learned how to drive these new cars, and to extract the most from them using the least ... Far from the unintelligent chancer many paint Hamilton to be, he is proving to be the intellectual match of his teammate and, the better racer to boot.[24] Their old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said Hamilton was the faster driver whereas Rosberg, who once said to Chiesa \"everything relates to physics and maths\", was always more analytical.[56] This led some to believe that Rosberg would achieve greater success in Formula One, the highest level of open-wheel racing, due to the intellectual capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management, and moderate fuel usage.[24] Hamilton's tyre management has frequently allowed him to push on for longer, often enabling optimum race strategies, and his fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone on the grid. Sky Sport's Mark Hughes, commented: \"Rosberg has a more scientific methodology, looks to fine-tune more specifically than Hamilton who typically tends just to find a balance he can work with, then adapt his driving around it.\"[2][107] In their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Rosberg won 54 of 78 races over four seasons. Hamilton had 32 victories, 55 podium finishes, and qualified ahead of Rosberg 42 times, while Rosberg had 22 victories, 50 podium finishes, and qualified ahead of Hamilton 36 times. During this period, Hamilton won two World Championship titles to Rosberg's one, and scored more points in three out of their four seasons together.[108] Sebastian Vettel[edit] Hamilton (left) and Vettel (right) at the 2017 United States Grand Prix Hamilton describes his rivalry with Sebastian Vettel as his favourite, believing their battles helped bring them closer together.[109] After three years of Mercedes's dominance from 2014 to 2016, Ferrari produced a car that was capable of fighting for the championship in 2017 and 2018.[110][111][112][113] Vettel, who was then driving for Ferrari, enjoyed an early lead on points, but Mercedes and Hamilton fought back to reduce point deficits and ultimately won the championships in both seasons. While there were some on-track flash points, most notably the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when Vettel accused Hamilton of brake checking and drove into Hamilton in retaliation, earning a penalty,[114] the pair developed a strong mutual respect in a hard but fairly contested fight.[115][116][117] In 2021, Hamilton recalled: Mine and Seb's battle were my favourite so far. It's knowing I was racing against an incredible driver, not only that but a great man in Seb who is a four-time world champion and we were racing against another team, he was at Ferrari who were very strong at the time. It took a lot out of both of us in that period of time, to remain focused to deliver weekend in, weekend out. That was a difficult period for us and it brought us closer, because the respect we have between us is huge.[118] Public image and influence[edit] Racist treatment[edit] Hamilton was racially abused by fans during 2010 pre-season testing at Jerez. The first and as of 2025 the only black driver to race in Formula One, Hamilton has been subject to racist abuse throughout his career. In 2007, Hamilton suffered racist abuse from Spanish Formula One supporters at the Chinese Grand Prix.[119] In 2008, Hamilton was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words \"Hamilton's familly [sic]\".[120] The FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour,[121] and launched a \"Race Against Racism\" campaign.[122] Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York-based advertising agency TBWA and named pinchalaruedadeHamilton, which translates into English as \"burst Hamilton's tyre\", was featured in the British media. The site contained an image of Interlagos that allowed users to leave nails and porcupines on the track for Hamilton's car to run over. Among thousands of comments left since 2007, some included racial insults.[123] In 2021, Hamilton was subjected to online racist abuse following a controversial win at the British Grand Prix. Mercedes, Formula One, and the FIA issued a joint statement condemning the abuse and called for those responsible to be held accountable.[124] Hamilton's treatment by the media and critics has, at times, been criticised as being racist. In 2014, The Guardian journalist Joseph Harker highlighted double-standards in Hamilton's treatment compared to other British drivers by British newspapers, suggesting that his skin colour has played a factor in a perceived lack of acceptance among the British public.[125] In 2019, footballer Rio Ferdinand described media scrutiny of Hamilton as having \"racist undertones\" and contrasted Hamilton's treatment to that of fellow British driver Jenson Button.[126] At the start of his Formula One career, Hamilton said that he \"tried to ignore the fact [he] was the first black guy ever to race in the sport\" but later stated that he had since grown to \"appreciate the implications\",[127] and changed his approach to promote equality within the sport.[128] In 2019, Toto Wolff, Hamilton's team boss at Mercedes, described how Hamilton was \"scarred for life\" by racist abuse inflicted during his childhood.[129] Media reception[edit] In December 2018, Stevenage-born Hamilton caused controversy at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards where he said on live television, \"It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums\" before immediately correcting himself, saying, \"Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.\" While Hamilton immediately sought to correct his remarks, the leader of Stevenage Borough Council described the comments as \"disappointing\" and observed that people felt \"very offended\".[130] Hamilton posted a video on Instagram in which he apologised for his comments, saying: \"I'm super proud of where I come from and I hope you know that I represent in the best way I can always ... Particularly when you are up in front of a crowd, trying to find the right words to express the long journey you've had in life, I chose the wrong words.\"[131] The town mayor subsequently accepted his \"gracious apology\".[132] Waxwork of Hamilton at Madame Tussauds, London Hamilton's contribution and influence has been recognised regularly in the Powerlist, an annual list of the most influential Black Britons, in which he has ranked in the top 10 in 2016 and 2017.[133][134] In 2021, Hamilton was named the most influential Black Briton in the 14th Powerlist, for his sporting success and his advocacy in the Black Lives Matter movement.[135][136] In 2020, he was listed as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to motorsports.[137][138][139] Hamilton was one of several figures whose tax arrangements were singled out in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008.[140][141][142] That year, Hamilton received criticism from members of parliament for avoiding UK taxes.[143] Following the leak of the Paradise Papers in November 2017, it was reported that Hamilton had avoided paying £3.3 million of value added tax (VAT) on his private jet, worth £16.5 million.[144] According to BBC Panorama, the leasing deal set up by his advisers appeared to be \"artificial\" and \"did not comply with an EU and UK ban on VAT refunds for private use\". The BBC also said that Hamilton's Instagram account provided evidence that the jet was used for personal trips.[144] The jet was sold in September 2019.[145] Whilst not residing in the UK, HMRC data published in 2019 puts Hamilton among the top 5,000 highest UK tax payers. Hamilton told The Sunday Times in 2014: \"What people don't realise is that I pay tax here [in the UK], but I don't earn all my money here. I race in 19 different countries, so I earn my money in 20 different places and I pay tax in several different places, and I pay a lot [in the UK] as well. I am contributing to the country.\"[146][147] ^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"THE DEBATE: How much better can Lewis Hamilton get?\".

Sainz has won four Formula One Grands Prix across 11 seasons. Born in Madrid, Sainz is the son of two-time World Rally Champion Carlos Sainz. Graduating from karting to junior formulae in 2010, Sainz won his first championship at the Formula Renault NEC in 2011 with Koiranen, finishing runner-up to Robin Frijns in the Eurocup that year. In 2012, Sainz contested British Formula 3, the Formula 3 Euro Series and FIA European Formula 3 with Carlin. Sainz progressed to the GP3 Series with Arden in 2013, finishing tenth in his rookie season. He then found success in the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, winning the championship in 2014 with DAMS. A member of the Red Bull Junior Team since 2010, Sainz signed with Toro Rosso in 2015, debuting alongside Max Verstappen. He remained at Toro Rosso until the 2017 United States Grand Prix, where he replaced Jolyon Palmer at Renault, having already signed with the team from 2018 onwards. Sainz moved to McLaren in 2019, ending his association with Red Bull. He took his maiden podium at the Brazilian Grand Prix that year, followed by another at the Italian Grand Prix in 2020. Sainz signed for Ferrari in 2021, replacing Sebastian Vettel to partner Charles Leclerc. After a winless debut season for Ferrari, Sainz took his maiden pole position and win at the British Grand Prix in 2022. He took further wins for Ferrari at Singapore in 2023, as well as Australia and Mexico City in 2024. Replaced by Lewis Hamilton for 2025, Sainz joined Williams to partner Alexander Albon, claiming a podium at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. As of the 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix, Sainz has achieved four race wins, six pole positions, four fastest laps and 28 podiums in Formula One. Sainz is contracted to remain at Williams until at least the end of the 2026 season.

      "content_urls": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)",
      "driver_profile": "Driver profile[edit] Driving style[edit] According to Williams's Dave Robson, Russell is an instinctive driver who can adapt to a variety of cars.[1] He has specifically been noted for controlling cars that are unstable when entering corners.[2] Compared to his former teammate Lewis Hamilton, Russell brakes earlier, turns later, and \"carries more speed through the corner and exiting it.\"[3] During the 2024 season, the racing press suggested that Russell's style might be a better fit for the present generation of ground effect cars than Hamilton's,[3][4] with Mark Hughes adding that Mercedes's successful midseason upgrades accentuated this F1-wide trend.[4] In his junior and early career, Russell's smooth driving style was compared to that of Jenson Button.[5] However, Robson (who worked with both Russell and Button at Williams and McLaren, respectively) suggested that Russell sought to strike a balance between Button and Lewis Hamilton.[1] Since joining Mercedes, Russell adapted his driving to take more aggressive and direct V-shaped approaches into corners, drawing comparisons to Mika Häkkinen,[6][7] although Jolyon Palmer argued that compared to Russell, Hamilton's V-shapes are more distinct.[8] Palmer also noted that Russell takes particularly wide exits out of corners to generate as much speed as possible, and said that Russell's precise car control allows him to survive risky turns.[8] Qualifying[edit] Throughout his career, Russell has consistently been praised for his qualifying pace. At Williams, the Briton drove an unimpressive car to unexpectedly high grid placements on several occasions,[9] most notably Spa 2021 (second) and Sochi 2021 (third).[10][11] He outqualified teammates Robert Kubica and Nicholas Latifi 57 out of 59 times.[12] Russell acquired the nickname \"Mr. Saturday\" for his Williams qualifying feats,[13][14][15] although he has downplayed the nickname, explaining that the goal is to win on Sunday.[16] At Mercedes, Russell became the only teammate in Lewis Hamilton's career (Hamilton being Formula One's all-time leader in pole positions) to outqualify him head-to-head during their time as teammates (39–29).[17] Although Hamilton outqualified Russell 13–9 in their first season together, Russell reached parity in 2023 and beat Hamilton 19–5 in 2024,[17] becoming one of only two teammates (the other being 2016 champion Nico Rosberg) to outqualify him in a single season.[18] Racecraft[edit] According to Karun Chandhok, Russell \"is generally one of the cleanest racers\" in F1.[19] Several drivers have noted Russell's clean racing on track, including teammate Lewis Hamilton[20] and Sebastian Vettel.[21] In addition, at the 2022 British Grand Prix, Russell jumped out of his car to check on Zhou Guanyu following a major first-lap crash, even though it triggered his own retirement from the race.[22] (The crash occurred after Pierre Gasly and Russell collided at the start of the race, bumping Russell into Zhou.[23]) However, after Russell questioned Charles Leclerc's defensive tactics during the 2023 British Grand Prix, Ferrari team principal Frédéric Vasseur noted that Russell had used similar tactics to defend his position in prior races, explaining that \"that's life\" in Formula One.[24] Russell's racecraft has received some criticism, as Russell has not always converted high grid placements into high finishes. As a rookie, Russell was plagued by poor starts; that year, \"he started lap two behind [teammate Robert] Kubica 11 times despite his qualifying superiority.\"[25] More broadly, it took Russell two and a half seasons to score his first points at Williams. The Race responded that Russell's race day struggles at Williams were primarily the fault of the car, reasoning that Russell's strong grid placements at Williams were \"in a constant battle against regression to the mean,\" and it was \"inevitable that his Sunday results [were] less impressive.\"[25] During Russell's years at Williams, Fernando Alonso said that Russell had great natural speed and \"surprises me every weekend\".[15] Following Russell's second-place finish at the 2025 Bahrain Grand Prix, Peter Windsor called Russell's drive \"one of the best I've seen in a long, long time\", praising his tyre management (Russell nursed a set of used soft tyres for over twenty laps), on-the-fly adjustments to various mechanical issues, and defensive positioning against third-placed Lando Norris, who had the faster car and the tyre advantage at the end of the race.[26] Russell's tyre management has alternately been praised and criticised. He was praised for his tyre management at Williams.[25] Upon joining Mercedes, he overextended his tyres on several occasions, contributing to some disappointing results.[27] His tyre management received renewed praise during the 2024 season, following strong performances at Spa,[28] Austin,[29] and Monaco.[30] Although Russell prioritized consistency during his first season with Mercedes, he began taking greater risks in the following seasons, and committed several high-profile mistakes, notably during the 2024 Canadian Grand Prix, where Motor Sport thought he botched Mercedes's first real chance at a win since 2022.[31] Following that race, Russell admitted that he \"need[s] to dial down the risk/reward [ratio] of how hard I'm driving,\" but explained that \"I'd prefer finishing P6 every race and having two victories rather than finishing P5, P4, P3 every race and not get the race victory.\"[32] He picked up two victories later that season. At the three-quarter mark of the 2025 season, The Daily Telegraph noted that Russell had submitted a \"largely error-free\" campaign.[33] Records and statistical oddities[edit] .mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}@media print{body.ns-0 .mw-parser-output .hatnote{display:none!important}}Main article: List of Formula One driver records Russell holds the record for most pit stops in a single race (7 at the 2023 Dutch Grand Prix), shared with Lance Stroll, Liam Lawson, and Alain Prost. Russell, Stroll, and Lawson all tied Prost's record at the same race.[34] Russell and Max Verstappen are one of two sets of drivers to tie for P1 in qualifying in Formula One history, at the 2024 Canadian Grand Prix. Previously, Jacques Villeneuve, Michael Schumacher, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen tied in qualifying at the 1997 European Grand Prix.[35] He tied with Verstappen again at the 2025 Spanish Grand Prix, this time for P3.[36] At the 2024 Belgian Grand Prix, Russell became the sixth driver in Formula One history to lose a race win by disqualification.[37] ^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}Kalinauckas, Alex (16 December 2021). \"Autosport 2021 Top 50: #12 George Russell\".

He then won the Masters of Formula 3 back-to-back in 2009 and 2010 with ART, before winning the GP3 Series in 2011.

After a winless 2018 campaign, Bottas finished runner-up to Hamilton in both the 2019 and 2020 seasons. He took his final win for Mercedes at the Turkish Grand Prix in 2021, leaving at the end of the season after contributing to five consecutive World Constructors' Championships. He joined Alfa Romeo in 2022, retaining his seat for his 2023 campaign. After a non-scoring 2024 season at the re-branded Sauber, Bottas returned to Mercedes as a reserve driver. Bottas has achieved 10 race wins, 20 pole positions, 19 fastest laps and 67 podiums in Formula One. He holds the Formula One record for the most career points without a World Drivers' Championship (1,797)."

      "driver_profile": "Driver profile[edit] Composure[edit] Piastri (pictured at the 2025 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix) has been acclaimed for his composure under pressure. Piastri has been noted by drivers and critics for his composure under pressure. In 2023, Scott Mitchell-Malm of The Race compared his \"relaxed intensity\" to that of Max Verstappen.[1] Upon winning the 2024 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Luke Smith of The New York Times stated that \"stress isn’t an emotion one would associate with Piastri. His calm, collected demeanor has been present right from his junior days.\"[2] This quality prompted several journalists to list him as a favourite for the 2025 World Drivers' Championship after the Bahrain Grand Prix,[3][4][5] with Martin Brundle comparing him to Alain Prost.[6] Andrew Benson of BBC Sport stated \"combining consistent speed [with] mental solidity and racing decisiveness [makes him] a formidable rival\".[7] After winning the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, title rival Verstappen stated \"he's very calm in his approach, and I like that. [...] He delivers when he has to, barely makes mistakes—and that's what you need when you want to fight for a championship\".[8] As his title battle with teammate Lando Norris emerged, Natalie Pinkham of Top Gear described him as \"the cerebral assassin\", adding that \"he races like he's solving a complex puzzle at [200 mph (320 km/h)]\".[9] His composed demeanour has drawn several comparisons to Kimi Räikkönen, widely known as the Iceman.[10][11][12] Development[edit] Piastri (pictured at the 2025 Japanese Grand Prix) has been noted for his development across his debut seasons. Piastri has also been lauded for his adaptability, with race engineer Tom Stallard commending his ability to identify flaws in real-time and make improvements without data analysis.[1] His ability to promptly learn from mistakes was initially noted by his engineer in the F4 UAE Championship.[13] Sky Sports described his rookie campaign as \"very impressive\", noting that his tyre management required improvement.[14] He was noted for his race pace development throughout 2024, as he took his maiden victories in Hungary and Azerbaijan—the latter was described by Luke Smith of The New York Times as a \"coming-of-age drive\".[15][16][2] By 2025, several critics opined that he had eradicated the tyre management and qualifying pace issues he experienced in his earlier seasons;[5][17][18][19] he worked closely with his engineers to solve the former and extensively analysed his past performances to iterate upon the latter.[20][21] ^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}Mitchell-Malm, Scott (18 August 2023). \"The F1 megastar-in-the-making traits of Oscar Piastri\".
